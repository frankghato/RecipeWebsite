            <h2>Bolognese</h2>
            <img style="width:300px" src="https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/5c2f8fe22efb8f2d33e396ca/master/w_1280,c_limit/bolognese.jpg">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>1 medium onion, chopped<br>1 celery stalk, chopped<br>1 small carrot, peeled, chopped<br>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 lb. ground beef chuck, patted dry<br>Kosher salt<br>3 oz. thinly sliced pancetta, finely chopped<br>1 cup dry white wine<br>1/3 cup tomato paste<br>1 bay leaf<br>Pinch of finely grated nutmeg<br>2 cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth<br>1 cup whole milk<br>1 lb. fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle, or dry rigatoni<br>2 oz. finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p>Step 1. Pulse onion, celery, and carrot in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl.<br><br>Step 2. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium. Break beef into small clumps (about 1½") and add to pot; season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally but not breaking meat apart, until beef is lightly browned but not crisp, 6–8 minutes. It may be gray in spots (that’s okay!) and still a little pink in the center. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl.<br><br>Step 3. Wipe out pot. Cook pancetta in pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until pancetta has released some of its fat and is crisp, 6–8 minutes. Add onion mixture to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft and beginning to stick to surface, 6–8 minutes.<br><br>Step 4. Return beef to pot and pour in wine. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, smashing down on beef with a wooden spoon, until wine is evaporated, surface of pot is almost dry, and meat is finely ground, 12–15 minutes. (The meat should be reduced to what looks like little bits. It takes a bit of effort, but you can take breaks.) Add tomato paste, bay leaf, and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally and still pressing down on meat, until tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 5 minutes.<br><br>Step 5. Pour stock and milk into pot; add a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until meat is very, very tender, 2–2½ hours. There shouldn’t be any rapid bubbles at this stage. Instead, the sauce should release the occasional small bubble or two. When finished, the sauce should have the texture of and look like a sloppy joe mixture. If the liquid reduces before the meat is completely tender, add an extra ½ cup stock and continue cooking. Discard bay leaf. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with salt; keep warm.<br>Step 6. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. If using fresh pasta, cook about 3 minutes. If using dry, cook until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.<br><br>Step 7. Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with sauce. Add 1 cup pasta cooking liquid and ½ cup Parmesan. Increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, and cook, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and liquid is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.<br><br>Step 8. Transfer pasta to a platter and top with more Parmesan.</p>

            <h2 style="padding-left: 8px;">Vietnamese Pho</h2>
            <img style="width:300px; padding-left: 8px;" src="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Vietnamese-Pho-Soup-Recipe-1.jpg">
            <h3 style="padding-left: 8px;">Ingredients</h3>
            <p style="padding-left: 8px;">2 3-inch pieces of ginger, cut in half lengthwise<br>2 onions, peeled<br>5 lbs. beef marrow or knuckle bones<br>2 lbs. beef chuck<br>5 quarts water<br>2 scallions, cut into 4-inch length<br>1/3 cup fish suace<br>2 1/2 oz. rock sugar<br>8 star anise<br>6 cloves<br>1 cinnamon stick<br>1 black cardamom pod<br>2 tsp. fennel seeds<br>2 tsp. coriander seeds<br>1 Tbsp. salt<br>1 lb. dried pho noodles<br>1/3 lb. beef sirloin, sliced paper-thin</p>
            <h3 style="padding-left: 8px;">Steps</h3>
            <p style="padding-left: 8px; margin-right:15px;">Step 1. Place the bones and beef chuck in large stockpot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and thoroughly clean the stockpot. This process removes any impurities/scum and will give you a much cleaner broth.<br><br>Step 2. Meanwhile, char your ginger and onions. Use tongs to hold the ginger and onions (one at a time) over an open flame, or place each directly on a gas burner. Turn until they’re lightly blackened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Rinse away all the blackened skins.<br><br>Step 3. Add water (5 quarts/4.75 L, or more/less if you've scaled the recipe up or down) to the stockpot and bring to a boil. Transfer the bones and meat back to the pot, along with the charred/cleaned ginger and onions. Add the scallions, fish sauce and sugar. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beef chuck is tender, about 40 minutes. Skim the surface often to remove any foam and fat.<br><br>Remove one piece of the chuck and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Then transfer this piece of beef to a container and refrigerate (you will slice this to serve with your pho later. If you were to leave it in the pot, it would be too dry to eat). Leave the other piece of chuck in the pot to flavor the broth.<br><br>Step 6. Now toast the spices (star anise, cloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom, fennel seeds, and coriander seeds) in a dry pan over medium low heat for about 3 minutes, until fragrant. Use kitchen string to tie up the spices in a piece of cheesecloth, and add it to the broth.<br><br>Cover the pot and continue simmering for another 4 hours. Add the salt and continue to simmer, skimming as necessary, until you're ready to assemble the rest of the dish. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning by adding more salt, sugar, and/or fish sauce as needed.<br><br>Step 7. To serve, boil the noodles according to package instructions. Add to a bowl. Place a few slices of the beef chuck and the raw sirloin on the noodles. Bring the broth to a rolling boil and ladle it into each bowl. The hot broth will cook the beef. Garnish with your toppings, and be sure to squeeze a lot of fresh lime juice over the top!</p>
